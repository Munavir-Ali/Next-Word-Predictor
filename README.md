# Next-Word-Predictor
This project demonstrates a Next Word Prediction system built using Deep Learning (LSTM) and trained on the Shakespeare dataset (alllines.txt). It predicts the most likely next word in a sentence using AI/ML techniques. The frontend is built using Streamlit for easy interaction.
